 * \section map_sec About video mapping
 * 
 * Projection mapping, also known as video mapping and spatial augmented reality,
 * is a projection technology used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into
 * a display surface for video projection. These objects may be complex industrial
 * landscapes, such as buildings. By using specialized software, a two or three
 * dimensional object is spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the
 * real environment it is to be projected on. The software can interact with a
 * projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object. This
 * technique is used by artists and advertisers alike who can add extra dimensions,
 * optical illusions, and notions of movement onto previously static objects. The
 * video is commonly combined with, or triggered by, audio to create an
 * audio-visual narrative.

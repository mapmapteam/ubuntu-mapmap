Datasheet
===========

User Interface
--------------
* Create and destroy an unlimited amount of video texture sources paints. Textures can be video or image files.
* Create and destroy an unlimited amount of mappings. Each mapping is a shape on which a source paint is drawn.
* Color paints can be used as masks.
* Move layers.
* Save the project to a human-readable XML file.
* Load the project from a human-readable XML file.
* OpenSoundControl (OSC) support.
* Turn any quad into a mesh.
* Properties inspector.

Supported codecs and file formats
---------------------------------

* At least 1 Gb of RAM.
* Video card with 3D acceleration, OpenGL 2.0 support and at least 64 Mb or VRAM.

Using the OSC interface
-----------------------
You can control MapMap via a set of OSC messages. OpenSoundControl allows users to send messages to control audio and video software. These messages are transmitted via UDP/IP. This allows one to control multi-projector shows with little efforts.

MapMap listens for incoming OSC messages on the default port 12345.
